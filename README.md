#  Destini App

## Our Goal

The goal of this challenge is to learn implementing the MVC design pattern on Storyboard based projects.

## Objective

In this app, you will be creating a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide a story-telling experience.
